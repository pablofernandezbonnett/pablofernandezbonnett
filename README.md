# Hello, folks 👋

![Pablo](https://github.com/pablofernandezbonnett/pablofernandezbonnett/blob/main/profile%20image.png)

> I build software meant to last.

I'm Pablo — a software engineer from 🇪🇸 Spain, living in 🗾 Japan and building systems with long-term intent.

Remote contractor. Product-minded engineer. Independent builder.

Focused on product, systems, and long-term thinking.

## 🧭 What I do

- Build and evolve production software systems
- Work close to product, not just code
- Improve legacy platforms and make them sustainable
- Design solutions meant for longevity, not just delivery

I enjoy shipping things that people actually use.

---

## 🚧 Currently building

- Tooling and components around e-commerce platforms
- Internal utilities using Flutter
- Backend services and integrations
- Experiments in game development (Unity / Godot)
- Quietly building ideas I may release someday

## 🧬 Tech DNA

**Core expertise**  
`Java` · `Spring` · `Hibernate` · `SAP Hybris` · `SQL`

**Frontend direction**  
`Flutter` · `Dart` · `Jaspr`

**Backend evolution**  
Exploring `Kotlin` as a natural step from Java —  keeping strong JVM alignment across the stack.

**Environment & tooling**  
`Docker` · `Git` · `VS Code` · `Postman` · `Figma`

I care about:
- clean architecture
- pragmatic engineering
- product-driven development
- maintainable systems over trendy stacks

## 🧠 Background

15+ years working on production systems across Spain, Ireland, and Japan.

Most of my career sits at the intersection of:
- e-commerce platforms
- enterprise systems
- product engineering
- modernization of legacy stacks

I like helping software evolve — not just grow.
